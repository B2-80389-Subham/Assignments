1.What is Numpy and how it is better than list in python?
numpy:

Numpy array is a collection of similar data-types that are densely packed in memory.
Numpy is able to divide a task into multiple subtasks and process them parallely.
Numpy functions are implemented in C. Which again makes it faster compared to Python Lists.

list:
A Python list can have different data-types, which puts lots of extra constraints while doing computation on it.

2. How to convert List into Tuple in Python?
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
output_tuple = tuple(input_list)
print(output_tuple)

3.How can you get list of unique elements from a given list?
input_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_elements = list(set(input_list))
print(unique_elements)
